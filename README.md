## DealerShip-Site
This site will be a replacement for my friend who owns a used car dealership. It will have a user page that will have all the info that they need to see like an inventory page, a home page with a featured vehicle that will change everyday. The inventory page will have a filter that will allow the user to narrow their search. Then there will be a seperate less elegant site for the owner of the dealership to add, remove, and update the vehicles they have up for sale.
